# EZStats

## Support/Update Discord Server: https://discord.gg/eRFyvbdFE8

A 1.7.10 Forge Mod to allow players to access easy stats like latency, FPS, and CPS.
Currently a work in progress, all code is accessable in this repository, and the final compiled .jar file will not be obfuscated.

I told Couleur that I would make a mod like this and it was pushed to the back of my head, but now that summer rolled around I have nothing better to do.

A 1.8.9 version will most likely be released along with this.

## If you would like to add this mod to your modpack/client send me a message on Discord: fruits#1845
