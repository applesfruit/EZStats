A 1.7.10 Forge Mod to allow players to access easy stats like latency, FPS, and CPS.
Currently a work in progress, all code is accessable in this repository, and the final compiled .jar file will not be obfuscated.

I told Couleur that I would make a mod like this and it was pushed to the back of my head, but now that summer rolled around I have nothing better to do.

## If you would like to add this mod to your modpack/client send me a message on Discord: fruits#1845

## CREDITS
I will not take ALL of the credit for me as I couldn't really have done it without any of these people. (Although it's not a hard mod for me to develop, a lot of these people were really helpful)
- Couleur - for inspiring me to make some kind of mod for 1.7.10.
- Canelex - for allowing me to use his mod system to allow all of the different mods
- Poiu - Although he didn't do much, he still helped with the less than ideal but sometimes working ping module.
